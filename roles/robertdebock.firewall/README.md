## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from `molecule/resources/converge.yml` and is tested on each push, pull request and release.
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.firewall
```

The machine needs to be prepared in CI this is done using `molecule/resources/prepare.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Prepare
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  become: yes

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.bootstrap
```

Also see a [full explanation and example](https://robertdebock.nl/how-to-use-these-roles.html) on how to use these roles.

## [Role Variables](#role-variables)

These variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```yaml
---
# defaults file for firewall

# If you don't specify a protocol in `firewall_services`, fall back to this.
firewall_default_protocol: tcp

# If you don't specify a rule in `firewall_services`, fall back to this.
firewall_default_rule: allow

# A list of service to allow traffic to.
firewall_services:
  - name: ssh

# A bit more difficult example:
# firewall_services:
#   - name: ssh
#   - name: https
#   - name: 5353
#     protocol: udp
#   - name: 1234
#     protocol: tcp
